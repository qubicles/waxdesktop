## API Node Recommendations

`WAX Desktop` the most powerful and user-friendly desktop wallet for the [WAX blockchain](https://wax.io). The list below contains API nodes run by members of the WAX community that you can choose from.

### Privacy

Even though your keys never leave the `WAX Desktop` application, the API node you connect to can still reveal personally identifiable information about you. This information may include:

- Account Names
- IP Addresses

If you are concerned about revealing this information to any of these 3rd party API nodes, it is recommended you run your own API Node and connect to that.
